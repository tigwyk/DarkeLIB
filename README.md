# DarkeLIB
The original DarkeLIB as used by Daybreak Ridge from 1999. i made some edits in 2005 wuth schroom and hellbringer.

thrace and i hosted darkelib as daybreak ridge in 1998 with traer. i got the darkelib from drizzt and zortek with permission.

# How to use
The following commands were run on linux mint 19.3 in a terminal window.  For all of the sudo commands you will need to enter your password for each of them.  Also I would recommend taking note of where you run this, as it will install in the location that you are currently at in a folder called DarkeLIB-master.
