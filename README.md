# DarkeLIB
The original DarkeLIB as used by Daybreak Ridge from 1999. This is a fork of parnells git repo.  Changes are being made to remove errors and make it easier to install.  This is also a place for wizards of the server we are working on to collaborate fixes and changes to the code.

# How to use
The following commands were run on linux mint 19.3 in a terminal window.  For all of the sudo commands you will need to enter your password for each of them.  Also I would recommend taking note of where you run this, as it will install in the location that you are currently at in a folder called DarkeLIB-master.
