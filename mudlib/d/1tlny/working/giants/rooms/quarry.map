 Q. Rd. = Quarry Road

"Actual quarry area" will be packed with slave-workers of different
races and different fighting power. And of course a bunch of slave-
drivers preferably greater orcs and shit(not set yet, but something
like that). This is only a little party of the entire village, it
will all be combined with main village, entrance area(projects of
Shakur) and the temple zone(project #2 of Deorwin)
