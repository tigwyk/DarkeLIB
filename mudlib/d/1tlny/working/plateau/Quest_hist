   During the years after Morodin's final battle, most of the details of his life were lost, including most of his contributions to the scholarly types of the day concerning the subjugation of magic, but one of the things that survived the years was Morodin's insestence that life and death are very close to the same, and his efforts to integrate that knowledge into known magicks.
    Of the people that witnessed Morodin's defeat, only one survived and that one could barely talk after the experience, but on his body were inscribed these words, "Balrog --- me --- true, but ---- 7 pieces ---- you may ---forge, and with -----Balrog."
    Centaurs that have escaped from the island babble on and on about protecting the sword pieces so that Balrog can concentrate. Many people have different ideas aboutthis, but the current and most widely accepted theory is that along with Morodin's curse, he created a sword that could defeat Balrog, and Balrog must keep this sword close to him, or he will slowly die, and Balrog, in an effort to make the sword less usable, broke it up into 7 pieces and hid 2 of them in a place that requires self sacrifice to attain.
