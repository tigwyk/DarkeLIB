Area:   Township of Tara
Coder:  Me alone
Date:   Sept 17, 1997
Theme:   A decent sized town of halflings,  built into
a hillside, the residents of this town prefer to stay within it's
limits.  Halflings have never been great fighters, prefering
instead a life of quietness.
Level: 1-6
Mobs: All kinds of halflings, children for the newbies, normal towns
members for the lowbies, and maybe a hidding group of thieves for
those braver adventurers

Progess:  I have added a good deal of the rooms, a few of the shops,
and am started do work on quest mobs for the "Quest for the Golden Pipe"
I dont know how long it will take me to finish the area, but I
am working hard on getting it done.
