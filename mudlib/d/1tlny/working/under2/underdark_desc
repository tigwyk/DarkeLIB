The Underdark Caves
by Vishnu
for the REAL DarkeMUD

The caves are the hidden road to the city of the Drow-elves.
Very few overworld dwellers know about such a place.  It will
be hard for them to learn of it, unless drow players tell them
(I plan for drow player characters to know about it somehow...).
The caves themselves will have progressively stronger (to an extent)
enemies as players descend.  The first level is for characters around
10th+ level.  It is filled with myconids (mushroom people).  The
myconids are a friendly race.  They are neutral to all other races.
They are lead by and elder and a council of myconids.  This council
governs and makes myconid law.  The myconids speak telepathically to
eachother, and therefore have no need to learn languages.

2nd level-
This level is for PC's level 13+.  Most of the mobs in here will be
duergar dwarves.  These dwarves are blue-skinned and for the most part
very evil.  They consider outsiders a threat to their community and attack
anyone.  The duergar mages are a force to be reckoned with... (level 15).
There may be a quest in this level... Probably something as cheesy as the
menzoberranzan computer game.  Like a quest for a holy item that was
stolen by the drow.

3rd (and final) level-
This is the last level of caves before the city of Kelantal(the drow
city) is reached.  Most of the mobs on this level will be drow scouts.
Other mobs will include the occasional gnome and some cave jellys (which
I plan to make eat weapons =P ) They will only eat a weapon if they
attack the wielding hand and make a random test though... I couldn't be 
TOO mean.

The city... (see kelantal)
