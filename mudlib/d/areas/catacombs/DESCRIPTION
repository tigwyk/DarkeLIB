Area: The Catacombs (or The Undead Catacombs)

 

Wizard: Duridian

 

Description: Beneath a crumbling crypt lies the domain of a powerful

undead and his horde of undead creatures.  The first level contains

mostly monsters an Apprentice could handle, while the lower levels

are populated by harder monsters.  The area is intended for Apprentice

and up.  The lich is extremely tough and can only be killed by a party

of high-level players.

Mobs: The evil lich on level three is very difficult and can only be

killed by a party of high-level players.  The rest of the monsters

range in level from 3 all the way up to 20.  Rufus Tenderfoot is a

quest monster and is level 50 (he is not to be killed).

 

Quest: The "Stolen Soul" quest involves returning a magical globe to

Rufus Tenderfoot that contains his soul.  The key from the wight at

catac145 opens the chest at catac147 which contains the Elixir of

Life.  The player must then give the Elixir to the evil lich at

catac214, who drops the magical globe that must be given to Rufus

Tenderfoot in catac148.  The players receives quest points, Rufus's

bone sword, and a few thousand experience points.

 

Future Plans: I am currently in the process of changing some of the

room descriptions and adding new monsters.

 

Weapons: Most of the weapons in the area are made of bone and give

special bonuses against undead.  The jewel-encrusted dagger wielded

by the lich contains several different type of special criticals.

The bone sword of Rufus Tenderfoot is very effective against undead,

especially skeletons.

 

Misc Objects: There is a fountain on the first level from which the

players can drink water, which enables them to heal more quickly.

 

Area Map: A map of the entire area is forthcoming.
