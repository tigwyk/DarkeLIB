/* This is the amulet worn by Owedquar's Shadow on the second floor of the black keep. It provides very little physical protection, but it does have one special use, when worn it gives 100% bonuses to concentrate, spell sense, fast casting and focus casting. This may seem like a lot, but the skills boosted do not cause any imbalance within the game, even if a newbie got to wear it, plus the amulet is extremely hard to get because to get it the player must kill Owedquar's Shadow. */
