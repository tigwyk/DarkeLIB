History of the Kobold Campgrounds



    In their attempts to contact the legions of Marghuul, followers of the

Order of the Blessed Return invoked strong magicks over which they had

little control.  One of their failed attempts involved an ancient ritual

used to transport creatures between planes of existence.  An inexperienced

wizard of the Order, T'natch M'nim, managed to channel an extraordinary

amount of energy through his body and contacted Florasia, the Plane of

Flowers.  In this dimension dwell many a peculiar race, including the 

Trunmen, small, bear-like humanoids with pointy ears.  The kobolds, a race

of small, greenish-skinned humanoids also live on Florasia.

     Unfortunately for the innocent inhabitants of a small kobold village,

Ishbi Rashim, T'natch's spell broke through the fabric of space and

forcibly carried the inhabitants of Ishbi Rashim into the Shadowlands.

Before they even had time to react, half of the kobolds were brutally

slaughtered by the guards of the Order of the Blessed Return.  Those who

were lucky enough to survive escaped into the plains of the Shadowlands.

For decades this miserable clan has roamed the countryside, scraping the

land for food and praying for the day when they might return to Florasia.

     Without anoyone to call friend, the kobolds live in a tight-knit 

community and are very leery of strangers.  They are led by a stocky

chieftain who forces his "subjects" to pick up and move their make-shift

homes periodically.  Their campground, which lies south of Akkad, is a

self-sufficient community, complete with a small standing army that has

repelled more than one attack by the vicious dwarven soldiers who reside

nearby.  A few tiny farms provide a small amount of food for the kobolds,

although the poor creatures rarely have more than a few months to grow

anything before their chief forces them to move along.
