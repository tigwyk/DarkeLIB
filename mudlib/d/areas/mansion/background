The elven army decided they wanted to deal a low

blow to the opposing orcs, so they hired an old

alchemist to develop some sort of plague to infect

the orc nation.  Something went wrong.  The elven

command sent a team to investigate and they never

returned.  Realizing the potential danger, an

elite second group was sent in to both investigate,

and test their potential.  It turns out that the

alchemist wasn't just working on the manufactured

disease, but he also had some other hideous

creations.  After the virus was accidentaly

released, it worked better than planned.  On the

wrong people.
