Area:  
  Bir'Barrutt
  
Wizard:
  Khojem

Description:
  A multi-phase implemented area of which this is phase 1 -
  Wastelands of Bir'Barrutt.  The entire area is a desert
  theme area of the Morrocan/Algeria motif.  Except for a 
  mummy I wanted to stay way from Egyptian.  The Wastelands
  is a desert area connecting the other three phases to be
  coded in the future.  Mobs in this area are levels 5-20,
  but mostly in the level 6-12 range.
  
Pathname:
  /d/khojem/nomad
  
World Map Location:
  /d/damned/virtual/room_21_12.world
  I already got this location reserved from Diewarzau.
  The area has four exit rooms that exit to this location.
  
Area Entry:
  /d/khojem/nomad/room/entry.c
  World map should have a desert road description and 
  "go road" for entry.
  
Future Phases:
  Phase 2 - Nomad Encampment at Bir'Barrutt
            A small nomad's camp with pub, shop(s), nomad chief,
            a cleric-type, harem, belly-dancers, eunuchs and 
            mobile guards.
           
  Phase 3 - Darke Temple of the Order of the Blessed Return
            A ruined temple relating to Mikus's history file.
            This will be a heavy magic area populated by Sword-demons.
            Nevin and I plan on coordinating this temple with his area's
            temple - similar mobs and artifacts.  We plan on a trans-
            area connected quest between our areas.
           
  Phase 4 - Well of Darke Souls of Marghuul
            A cave complex with undead creatures that are mistakes(?) 
            from the Darke Temple of the Order of the Blessed Return.
            Weapons recovered in the Wastelands will come in handy here.
           
Mobs:
  Most mobs are mobile and confined to the area.  A few mobs can only
  be found by room search commands.  I used the mud's default stats
  based on mob level for setting all skills, hp's, and mp's.  Since
  the Gods put this mechanism in I thought it best for them to have
  a good test of their inherent balancing.  Most animal mobs do not
  have money.  Non-animal mobs generally have money and equipment.
  Higher level mobs have spells.
  
Quest:
  Nutnux, a lvl 20 fighter mob, roams the wastelands in search of his
  sash, the quest item.  A quest summary and how to solve it is in
  /d/khojem/nomad/obj/nutnux_quest_summary.  The quest object
  file is in:  /d/khojem/nomad/obj/nutnux_quest_ob.c and will
  require copy to the quest directory.  The quest item is found in:
  /d/khojem/nomad/obj/quest_sash.c.

Weapons:
  Several weapon-types are loaded into this area.  They all are coded
  with set_wield functions against undead creatures and checks the 
  player's skill level for the weapon on wield.  Most of these
  are slightly better than the weapons supplied from the virtual server.
  Nutnux carries a rapier weapon.  It is intended as an offhand weapon.
  These can be found in:  /d/khojem/nomad/weapon
  
Armor:
  Few armor items are loaded in this phase.  Mostly they are sashes worn
  as belts.  A cloak-type armor is worn by Harghuul, a sword-demon guardian
  of the temple.  I plan on adding a good deal of armor in the future
  phases.  Armors are found in:  /d/khojem/nomad/armor
  
Misc Objects:
  /d/khojem/nomad/obj contains various objects required for the area.
  The compass and roulette_wheel objects will appear in the future at the
  encampment.  The spider_chest is a lock-pick only item (a key is not 
  loaded, but supplied for testing in non_key.c).  Several monolith objects
  are here to communicate with the players.  The sign is used to warn 
  players away from a nasty one-way entry to a cave complex.  The sand_key
  is used to open a hidden door in the cave.
  
Added Notes:
  The ravine area in the northwest corner has some negative add_hp()
  function calls when players attempt to climb the ravine.  Flight
  capable players will avoid this damage.
  
  The sand marsh is a one-way entry area with a hidden exit to the
  ravine.  The area is stocked with a few spiders and a hidden, locked
  door to a tomb.  The tomb has a hidden trapdoor to a pit worm.
  
  The directory:  /d/khojem/nomad/camp has some files I coded 
  recently for the encampment.  These can be ignored.
