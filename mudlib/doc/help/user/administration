                    Wizard Levels and Responsibilities

God Wizard - (Tlny, Tiny)
The God Wizard position is responsible for all that occurs on the mud.
Any God level may instruct any other wizard in any matter concerning
the mud.  Currently we are operating with a Triumvarate system with
Drizzt, and Admin's Shadowraith and Zortek operating together.
Diewarzau shall not be disturb.  The buck stops with the Tri.  Please
do not try to go behind one person's back to another, we talk to each
other and it will aggravate your situation.

    Drizzt is responsible for everything.  He is the appeals God.
    He handles overall Mud Balance and has final say on change of
    Theme or Direction.  You may contact Drizzt if you disagree with
    a decision rendered by the Day Admin.

    Diewarzau is responsible for core coding.  He is outside the loop
    and not to be contacted with problems unless one of the Tri tell
    you to mail him.  Leave him alone lest you suffer in purgatory
    forever and ever amen.  From him all good things flow.  Diewarzau
    may of course change policy/theme/direction at any time, but for
    the most part he will be outside the daily admin flow.


Admin Wizard - (Various)
The Admin Wizard position is responsible for the day to day
administration of the mud.  All questions should be directed to them
before you bother a God Wizard.  The Admin Wizards maintain security,
and monitor for abuse/cheating by players and all levels of wizards.
They work with the God Wizards to implement grand dreams into daily
realities.

    Shadowraith is the Day to Day operations Admin.  He is the initial
    contact point for all player disputes that cannot be handled at
    a lower level.  He monitors for player/wiz cheating and abuse and
    approves all new wizards.  He is also responsible for the WWW page.

    Zortek is the Security Admin.  He is responsible for core coding and
    tracks down severe bugs that cannot be handled at a lower level.
    Do not approach him with player disputes since he prefers to remain
    out of politics and just code.


Arch Wizards (Various)
The Arch Wizard is responsible for a specific area of mud developement.
In their specialty, they are supreme, and will almost without exception
be backed up by Admin and God.

    Khojem is the Balance Arch.  All code is subject to his review for
    balance with the mud as a whole.  Elder Wizards and above may put
    code online without Khojem's direct review, but if he asks you to
    change it, do so or appeal to Shadowraith.  In almost all cases
    Khojem will be backed up by the administration.

    Mikus is the History Arch.  As such, he will preapprove all new
    areas before you begin coding to insure they fit into the history
    and the theme of the mud.  Mikus also has the authority to ask that
    any item, monster, spell, skill or creation be removed if he feels
    it does not fit into the theme and history of the mud.  Appeals as
    with Khojem, support is the same too.

    Warsyn is the Game Design Arch.  He reviews the mud from the wizard
    and player level and makes comments on what works and does not.  If
    he asks you to change something, give it consideration, or mail him
    why you feel your code should remain unchanged.


Mentor Wizard - (Various)
The Mentor Wizard is a workhorse position.  Along with their normal
projects, they are responsible for a domain of the mud and are
responsible for monitoring and guiding Wizard level coders.  Every
Wizard Level must have a designated Mentor.  Mentors are always 
the first level of wizards who may assist players with MINOR problems
which does not include restoration of exp or skills.  Mentors may
grant players a normal penalty reincarnation.  Mentors and above may
recommend a player for promotion to wizard and this recommendation will
normally be approved.


Elder Wizard - (Various)
Elder wizards have completed at least one area or contribution to the
mud and have been promoted by their Mentor, having earned his/her trust.
Elder wizards may add code to the mud in their areas without getting
approval from Balance Arch first, however if Balance wants a review
Balance gets it.  Elder Wizards have earned some trust from the mud and
the Administration is much more willing to take arguements from them.

Wizard - (Various)
Wizard is the beginning position in the mud.  They are supervised by a
Mentor and may not add code into the mud system (where players can get
to it) without approval from Balance.  They should feel free to ask
questions from their Mentors.  This is a temporary position, with
people either moving up or out from here.  Wizard level coders may not
have a player character until they are promoted to Elder.  Wizard level
coders may not interact with players save on a social not to interfere
basis.  Wizards may have test character IAW /open/wiz_characters but
that character should never interfere with a mortal.
Note: This is the easiest level to get demoted from.  If you think you
might be doing something you shouldnt be, you probably are.
If you think arguing with an Arch or Mentor will get you somewhere, it
will not.  Mentors or above can recommend your removal from the mud and
it will be granted since it indicates you canqnot play well with others.
