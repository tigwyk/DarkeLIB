=-=-=-=-=-=- The low down on beta testing! -=-=-=-=-=-=
Ok, here is the deal.  We are moving back to beta testing
because there were more bugs than expected.  Going back
to beta is not as bad as it sounds.  All it means is we will
not be reimbursing all the time.  We will re-open when all
the bugs are taken care of and we will also have about 6 more
guilds up.  Maybe we will have the war system ready too.
Diewarzau has qualifiers for his PHD on the 15th & 16th.  After
that he will be back to code and things will come up faster.
All players will be reincarnated again when we open.
help reincarnation for more info.  The reincarnation will be
cost 1/2 of your levels rounding down.  Hang in there!  We will rock...
just takes time to code all of this stuff.

Here is what you will lose after beta:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
1.  1/2 your levels, rounding down.  This may seem like it sux, but we 
will be advertising for new players when we open, and you will have a 
major jump on all of them.

2.  EVERYTHING in your castle except the first room.  Everything in the 
first room (doors, features, etc.) will be lost also.  CHESTS AND PETS IN 
THE FIRST ROOM WILL BE RETAINED.  A week before opening, you will be 
warned to move all the stuff you want to keep into the first room of your 
castle.  For that week, pick lock, bash lock, and lock smithing skills 
WILL BE DISABLED, so even a cheap lock will assure the safety of any chest.
If you cannot afford a cheap lock, you dont need the chest anyway, and 
you can always upgrade locks later if desired.  Remember that safes can 
be locked too.

3.  EVERYTHING you may have gotten from a quest (except platinum, but 
there is really no way around that, unless I take everyone's money, 
which would suck).  You will have to redo the quests.  If you received 
quest points from an arch as a reward for anything, you will have to see 
him AFTER the mud is open to get the qp back.


What you will keep:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
1.  1/2 of your levels.  The glass is half full after all.

2.  All the stuff in chests or safes and all the pets in the FIRST ROOM 
only of your castle.  Runes and forges will also be retained if they are 
placed in the first room.  I realize that forges are very easy to steal, 
but if you mail me (diewarzau, do not trouble other arches about this), 
and SHOW ME YOUR FORGE, I will disintegrate it, then give it back to you 
after we open.  I will only do this for greater forges.

3.  The first room of your castle, but no features or doors on it.

4.  All your money in safes and on your person.

5.  All the stuff in your inn room if any.  The deal for forges above 
does NOT apply to inn rooms.

6.  If you decide not to change guilds and you are a guildmaster, you 
will stay the guildmaster.  If you intend to change guilds and are a 
guildmaster, you can insure that a certain player in your guild will 
become gm by giving him or her the 'new guildmaster' priviledge.  This 
will be read at the time of opening, and the guildmastership will be 
set.  In this case you will lose both your guildmaster object and the 
guildmaster weapon/necklace/whatever that auto-loads with the object.  
If you assign this priv. to more than one person, the first one to log 
on after opening gets it.  If you do not assign it, the NPC guildmaster 
will reappear.

7.  The option to return to your original guild.  If for some reason your 
gm will not let you into the guild which you were in BEFORE opening, 
alert an arch and we will allow you.  We will check the logs to see if 
you are telling the treuth of course.
