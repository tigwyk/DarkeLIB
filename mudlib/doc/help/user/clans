=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- DayBreak Clan System -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Finally we have a way to integrate clans and the cross training
system!  Well here goes.

1)  Clans are ran totally by the players.
2)  To start a clan you must be above level 26 and not a GM!
    The clan leader invites who he wants.  And is the head
    of the clan,
3)  No player can join the clan if he or she is within 8 levels 
    of the leader.
4)  Now the cross traning part.  Players inside the clan can
    train eachother.  You can only teach if you have over 60% 
    in a skill or 3 in a spell.  You can only teach up to half
    of you level.  There for spells can only be trained to
    lvl 3 and skills can go higher than 60 if the trainer has 
    over 100%.  There will be a train room inside the clan 
    castle(I will get to clan castles later) that clan members 
    can train.  It requires both the trainer and trainie.  It 
    costs money for the trainie to train.

5)  Ohh... now the fun part begins! Clan Castles(Strongholds)
    The clan leader can buy a clan castle.  These suckers are 
    going to be big.  They will house clan train rooms.
    Clan members will have room ownership inside the stronghold.
    So the clan members can customize their section of the
    stronghold.  There will basically be the same options.
    Other kewl things about the strongholds.  Well now there will
    be more people on to defend their castles.  There will also
    be siege engines to knock down doors in castles.  They will
    be built by tinkers and it takes like 10 people to use one.
    Basically we want clans to war against each other.  There
    will also soon be two more cities, so we can break up where
    the guilds are located.  The world map will also be expanded.

6)  What about GM's... well since they can't join clans.  The
    GM will form their own clan.  And can't invite members.
    In effect the clan council is a clan.  They may train from
    each other.  Their role will be to run the guilds and try
    to keep order between the clans.  Try to keep clans from
    taking over cities etc...

The basic idea is to move the center to clans from guilds.
Encourage role play interaction and to have fun.  Clans will
want to be well rounded and have most every guild in their
clan.  

If you have any comments, questions, or suggestions mail ME
not all of the arch's.

You can thank Warsyn for coming up with the clan system design.
