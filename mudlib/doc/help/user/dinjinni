=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-      Dinjinni      -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

       Dinjinni are a powerful race that originates from the
Elemental Plane of Air.  While few leave their usual home, some
have made their way to the Darkelands for various reasons known
only to them (and perhaps to those who summoned them).  They
have a pale blue skin, dark hair, and very clear eyes.  Their
upper torso would appear to be human if it weren't for the fact
that their lower body is made of smoke and various vapors.  These
creatures are the master of the air and it is difficult to defeat
one when it is in its element.  Being that the surface of the
land is rarely without air, this can be a tremendous task indeed.
       Being incredibly agile, Dinjinni are also fairly strong
and tough beings as well.  Also, most are fairly intelligent as
well which can make them an excellent ally or a deadly foe.
In combat, most Dinjinni will attempt to use their hands to 
pummel their foes.  It has been said that a Dinjinni's blows
at times are able to cause tremendous damage to the detriment
of their foes.  Dinjinni of course are incredibly gifted flyers,
able to accomplish tremendous feats of skill within the air.
It is said that a Dinjinni is also resistant to the affects of
hostile magic, but that is only speculation at this point.
