=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-        Gnoll       -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

       Gnolls are large humanoid hyena-like creatures which roam
the plains, and sometimes other terrains, of the Darkelands.
These creatures have a humanlike body with a large hyena shaped
head with a short, reddish-gray to dull yellow mane.  They have
fur over most of their bodies as well.  Gnolls often work in 
small packs and are fierce hunters of all things, even humans.
Some Gnolls venture to the cities of Darke for training in the
various fighting skills of the land, while some even take up the
more mentally taxing skills of magic.  Eventually, however, these
Gnolls will return again to their homelands to serve the pack
once again, even more deadly now.
       Gnolls vary a great deal.  Some are smarter than others,
while some are stronger than others.  It is impossible to know
what a Gnoll has up its proverbial sleeve for they always appear
to be grinning.  Most are very wary when around a Gnoll for they
have a bad reputation of being incredibly violent, though this
is not always the case.
