chaotic neutral while others tend towards good or evil.  Nereids 
are invisible in water, but upon contact with air, they assume
human form, usually as voluptuous young females with long golden 
hair, pearly white skin, and sparkling green eyes.  Their voices 
and songs are lovely.  A nereid always carries a little white 
shawl, either in its hands or over head and shoulders, and is 
lightly clad in white and gold.
