=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-      North Men     -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

       North Men are large, heavily muscled humans who dwell far
to the north in the cold dark wastelands of Darke.  These peoples
form large tribes which are often guided by a shaman or a fierce
chieftain.  These tribes are fiercely competitive with one another
and often make bloody war upon each other, though these wars are
most often single battles (or even raids upon a village to capture
slaves, wealth, and often mates as well).  Many of these people
never leave their frozen homes, being suited to colder climates,   
though some have been known to ply their trades elsewhere in the
lands.  A prophecy has been made that says that one day a great
leader will come who will unite the North Men under one ruler and
that he will lead them against the lands of the south to gain great
wealth for his people, but as of yet that prophecy has not been
fulfilled.
       North Men are strong and hardy humans who tend to rely
heavily upon their physical strength and stamina to elevate their  
positions in their tribes.  Most hold a strong fear of magic and
the supernatural, though some of them do brave and conquer these
pursuits (which most find they seem surprisingly proficient in
these areas).  Most North Men learn very quickly compared to the 
other races of the land, and though it is uncommon you will find
them scattered among the many guilds and professions of Darke.
