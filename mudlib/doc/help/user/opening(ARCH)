Ok, this doc is pertaining to the opening and what events will
happen at the opening! I.E. reincarnations etc...
First let me explain to you our position and my feelings on this.
For we can wait till we get all of the other guilds up... or we 
can open ASAP..(soon as we finish tweakin a few more things..
prob 2 weeks).  Now here is the deal.. we are in BETA TESTING.
Beta testing means you are testing the mud... not playing it.
We the admin, would like to show our appriciation by letting
you keep your characters.  The thing is... do we let you keep 
them as is (a free reinc) or cut levels in the reinc.
There were major balance problems with the mud and I think we
finally have them under control.  That is why we did testing
before we opened. Major problems being we don't have the bloody
support for lvls past 20!!!  We screwed up the balance with exp
and the high lvl players ran away from us.  We also don't have
the areas to support these players.  Flat out we are up against 
a wall with these high level players.  I don't want to screw the
players by taking away many days of play time.  I know many worked
hard, but you have to understand our position.  So that basically
says that is the deal...

OK, HERE IS THE BIG NEWS! ... This is what is going to happen!

1) We want to open as soon as we round off the other guilds,
   fix the other bugs and round off the balance.
   Hopefully this would be in about two weeks.
2) Next, we would do a mudwide reinc and everyone would lose
   half their levels. (It has to be done!)
3) Guildmasters would stay GM's when we opened to stop the
   confusion and limit the flow of players to each guild.

I have talked to high level people like Sagan and even he
understands.  He is also the oldest player on the mud and
stands to lose the most.  We are not doing this because we 
want to, but we have to.

Now, don't go slaying everyone because you think your character is 
worthless.  Some people like to play.  If you go out and do this.
You will be starting at level one because I will have deleted you!
I am serious about this!  I will not tolerate the bullshit that
happened last time.  You have no idea how pissed off I was last
time.  We have put in 10 times more work than you have.  Show
some damn respect.  If you have a serious problem with this... bummer.

Lastely, I wish some of you would start roleplaying!  It makes the mud
much more fun.  Stick up for your guild... Paladins should not be
killing people for the hell of it.  Sorry, if I am directing this
at some people (this is just an example).  The admin has worked hard
designing this mud for you.  I take it as an insult that some of you
are fucking it up by pulling some bullshit.  If people play right
it will be more fun for all. 

And for you loyal players... thanks for standing by the mud.  This
mud will go places and I hope it will be huge.  We will continue
to expand the mud and make it better.  I am guessing everything
that is planned so far (the rest of the guilds, clan system, war
system, etc..) will hopefully be up in 2 months.. maybe 3.  More
areas are to come... we are coding all of the areas we can.  You
can only code so many with so few coders.  Again thanks for the
support and help with beta.
