		    =-=-=- Paladin -=-=-=

	Paladins are semi spell casters who concentrate
heavily on chivalric combat. The Paladin is the epitome of
Arthurian knighthood. A noble and heroic character, the
Paladin is the symbol of all that is just and right in the
world. The Paladin should be played carefully in regard to
moral style, as any variance from his high ideals and
convictions turns his great strength into bloody hypocrisy.
