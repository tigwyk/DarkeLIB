     Pets are an important part of DayBreak.  Several summon spells
can give you a pet.  They can do anything from carrying stuff to
killing stuff to helping guard your tresure, and sometimes more.
Anytime you summon a pet, you should ask it for help.  You talk to
pets the same way you talk to any other NPC (see 'help
communication').
