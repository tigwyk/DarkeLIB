=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- Reincarnation -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
	Reincarnations allow a player to save their exp and quest 
points.  They are put back into the setter, select a new race & 
guild.  You get new stats.  The exp is put into a "exp bank".  
Once you have finished spending your dev points, you can type
advance and you will advance a level.  This is to allow you to
slow develop skills, so you do not get screwed on your dev points.
	You can ask to receive a reincatnation, but you lose level/2.
I.E. if you were level 10 you would be level 5.  We do give out free
reincarnations for the following reasons... shitty stats, screwed up 
as a newbie in making your character, or any weird ass bug.  Just ask 
an arch to reincarnate you and the reason you wish to be reincarnated
and you are set.

Note: If you have made second character, please mail an arch of the names
	so we do not delete all of your characters.
         YOU MAY ONLY HAVE 1 CHARACTER!   NO SECONDS
            Tlny- You can have as many guys as you want! Multi playing allowed
