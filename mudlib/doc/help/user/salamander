              =-=-=-=-=-=- Salamander -=-=-=-=-=-=

Salamanders are natives of the elemental plane of Fire, and thus 
they thrive in hot places.  These cruel, evil creatures come to 
the Prime Material plane for reasons only known to them.  The head 
and torso of a salamander is copper-colored and has a human-like 
appearance.  Most of the time, this aspect is a male, with a flaming 
beard and moustache.  The female version has flowing, fiery red hair.  
Both aspects have glowing yellow eyes that sometimes switch to 
fluorescent green.  Salamanders usually carry a shiny metal spear.  
The lower torso is that of a large snake, with orange coloring
shading to dull red at the tail end.  The entire body is covered with
wispy appendages that appear to burn but are never consumed.
