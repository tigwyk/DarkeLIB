        When the Demiurge seeded the planet eons ago, he populated it
with a race of divine power and wisdom.  The members of this race were so
intelligent, that they mastered the arts of magic and science very
quickly and began experimenting on the lower forms of life on their
planet.  Controversy over the treatment of these other forms of life,
many of which had achieved sentience, caused a great division in the
divine race.  A mighty war ensued, and most of the survivors left to
another plane of existence.  Those who remain on the victorious side 
are the Seraphim.  They are a beautiful, radiant people, resembling humans 
with white, feathered wings.  The seraphim champion the causes of order   
in the various realms of the world, usually selecting the professions of
paladin or priest.
