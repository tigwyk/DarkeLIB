           =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- Sword Demon -=-=-=-=-=-=

	The Great War between the factions of the progenitor race sent 
the sword-demons into exile in the lower planes.  Several of them have 
managed to return to the prime material plane, usually by tricking an 
unfortunate mage into summoning them, after which the mage is promptly 
slain.  The sword demons are determined to reassert their position on the 
world as rulers supreme, and they will do just about anything to do it.
Sword demons are a fearsome sight.  They may stand as tall as seven feet, 
with vicious claws and blood red skin.  Leathery wings sit folded above 
their shoulders, allowing limited flight.  Their eyes are bright 
green-yellow and slanted evilly.  They enjoy practicing both magic and 
combat, and represent some of the most powerful elementalists and chaotic 
lords on the planet.
