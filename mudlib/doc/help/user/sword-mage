		    =-=-=- Sword-Mage -=-=-=

	The Sword-Mage is in essence a dual class Arch-Mage
and Fighter. He combines the realms of Arms combat and Spell
casting. His might with weapons combat is well augmented by
his Magical abilities, which make him a good companion in
adversity and a fierce foe in conflict. 

Type:   Semi-Warrior
Skills: Combat 
Spells: Some Arch-Mage stuff
Prime Attributes: Dex, Int, Str

Examples: Combine a middle level fighter and arch-mage, what
	do you get? A warrior who can stand his own and throw
	an occasional fireball.
Comments: These warriors have the combat skills to protect
	themselves, and if provoked have some nice spells to
	blast their opponents with.
