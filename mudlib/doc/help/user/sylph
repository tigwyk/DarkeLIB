              =-=-=-=-=-=- Sylph -=-=-=-=-=-=

Sylphs are beautiful, humanoid women with wings like dragonflies.  
Their wings are 4-5 feet long and translucent, clear or spotted 
with iridescent color.  Their long bright hair may be and 'normal' 
color, or blue, purple, or green.  They wear flowing diaphanous 
robes which accent their wings or hair.  Sylphs are related to air 
elementals and to nymphs, perhaps originating as a cross between 
nymphs and aerial servants.  Sylphs can speak common and their own 
musical language.
