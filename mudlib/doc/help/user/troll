    Hideous travesties of sagacious Treeherds, Trolls possess 
huge, hulking bodies patched by bushes of harsh, wiry hair.  
Ill-proportioned hands and feet display granite claws, while 
flattened nostrils deformm  a cruel visage.  A perpetual snarl
distorts the sneering maws of these battle fiends to reveal
curving, blood-stained fangs.  Grey, stony hides with the 
rough texture  of a cliff face protect the calcified innards
or reclusive, solitary Trolls.  They also regenerate at incredible
speeds and can also regrow lost limbs.
