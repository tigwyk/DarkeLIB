           =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- Vulfen -=-=-=-=-=-=


    Furred men with wolfish heads and tails, Vulfen are often
confused with werewolves, to the detriment of these shapechangers.
Cunning intelligence shapes the behavior of Vulfen, but cruelty and
bloodthirst deprive them of human respect and liking.  Their own
armament of fangs and claws is often supplemented by weapons.
