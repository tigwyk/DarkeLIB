		    =-=-=- War-Priest -=-=-=

	A War-Priest's path is highly influenced by his god and
many patterns in his life are formed by his religious training.
The difference between a Priest of a war god and one of a god
should be readily apparent. Not only should the two behave
differently, but they should have greatly divergent skills.
	These priests of the dieties of war, combat, and 
conflict are crusaders of the faith, and they stand at the
forefront of the fight for their faith. They are often
organized in a militant hierarchy and view their temples as
fortifications as well as places of worship.

Comments: More combat oriented and less healing inclined than

	faith. While Clerics adventure to spread the faith,
	War-Priests venture forth to actively seek out the
	enemies of the faith as well as defend their beliefs.
