	The Warrior-Monk is a "fanatic" martial artist who
has been brought up in a relatively isolated and restrictive
environment. He is dedicated to the martial arts and personal
discipline. His intensive martial arts background leads to
relatively low skill developments for martial arts and
related skills, but relatively high costs for unrelated skills.	

Type:   Martial Warrior
Skills: Lots of martial art combat skills
Spells: None
Prime Attributes: Str, Con, Dex

Examples: blink? Think of an ancient martial artist and his
	remarkable capabilities.
Comments: The warrior-monk focuses on all aspects of unarmed
	combat. He prefers using little or no armour or
	armament, relying on his own rigorously trained body. 
	His unarmed combat abilities are highly respected by all.
