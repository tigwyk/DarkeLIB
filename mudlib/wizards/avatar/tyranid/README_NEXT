Ok, that was just an idea what what they "really" are.  
Tyranids are one of the races from a wargame called
Warhammer 40000.  Ever since I bought their sourcebook I 
have wanted to code them for a mud.

The "real" background doesn't fit in with DarkeMUD very well,
but since very few people would know the "real" background
they can easily take the role of invading demons, evil
indiginous race, etc.

The area I want to do would be a Tyranid Hive.  Its a sort
military base used by the Tyranids, though like all of
their instalations, its alive.

The area would be a fairly complex maze-like grouping
of tissues that make the thing up...starting in the large
intestine, and working up through the small intestine,
stomach, heart, lungs, neck and finally to the head
and brain itself where the Hive Tyrant would be waiting.

I can present a map and a more detailed breakdown of the
critters once I actually code them.  Tyranids aren't much
on money or equipment (though they do have a few organic
toys) so their main contribution would be a killing area
comparable to Ash (though with higher level monsters as 
you move up in the hive).  Hopefully this would take 
some of the pressure off Ash.
