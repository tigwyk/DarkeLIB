Description:         The files in the tyranid directory give a basic 
                     explanation of what Tyranids are, along with a map
                     (though it doesn't show the 43 up/down passages that
                     connect the various levels) and a list of the Tyranid
                     types (showing their level and the map key room type 
                     they can be found in).

                     Note that the more powerful Tyranids are nonstandard
                     monsters and have some unusual abilities including
                     multiple attacks per round (in some cases as many as
                     5 or 6), invisibility, special armour (makes them
                     completely immune to damage 25%-40% of the time) and 
                     the ability to produce automatic criticals (impaling,
                     plasma, constriction and/or aether depending on the
                     specific creature in question.  Also a few cast 
                     standard spells.

Pathname:            /wizards/avatar/tyranid

World Map Location:  08x 34y
                     "A huge structure is dimly visible through the mist"
                     "hive"

Area Entry:          /wizards/avatar/tyranid/rooms/entry.c

Mobs:                Many.  See above comments and tyranid_list for details.
                     They are in /wizards/avatar/tyranid/mon

Quest:               None at this time...maybe later.

Future Plans:        None to speak of...may add in special rooms scattered
                     throughout the body that feature some of the more
                     rare/obscure Tyranids (spore mines, biovores, flesh
                     borers, gene stealer mages, hormagants, and such) or
                     add more atmosphere.

Weapons:             Tyranids use living creatures as weapons, so they come
                     in only one condition (5 - superb) and never get dull
                     as the creature's natural healing process repairs the
                     wear.  I could put in an actual "regeneration" process
                     that would slowly repair the weapons if preferable.

                     With the exception of the Spinefist wielded by the
                     Hive Tyrant, the weapons aren't much to write home 
                     about.  Oh yeah, they're made of chitin.  Its a dummy
                     material, but its appropriate for them.  Weapons are
                     in /wizards/avatar/tyranid/obj

Armour:              Only one piece of armour, its not very good but is in
                     /wizards/avatar/tyranid/obj

Added Notes:         As some of the creatures are substantially more deadly
                     than "standard" monsters of their level, I have made
                     them worth more in exp.
                     Also, you can pick up food and water in the stomach of
                     the hive if you pay attention to the long descriptions.
                     This is only possible in two specific rooms out of the
                     45 in the stomach area.
